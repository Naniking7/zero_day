##New Things I've Learned 

#Git repository creation
You will need a GitHub account. After you set your account up, you will need to create a repository, a public one. On your local computer, open git bash, navigate to the home directory create a new directory _mkdir dirname_

#Bringing what you created on the remote (GitHub) to your local computer
In the new directory created; 
1. _git clone repository URL_
2. Identify yourself by _git config --global user.name "Your name"_ to add your name on GitHub and _git config --global user.email_ to add your email address
You are all set now and can add README files and push them to the remote repository.
